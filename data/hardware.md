At home, I work on a **Mac Pro** (*QuadCore 3.7GHz*, 16Go RAM), _overkill_ but fun. With three 27" Samsung displays, rack-mounted.  
I use an old **Behringer FCA 202** (Firewire audio interface), plugged in a [Behringer Xenyx Control2USB](https://www.musictribe.com/Categories/Behringer/Signal-Processors/Headphone-Amplifiers/CONTROL2USB/p/P0BP0), plugged to two pairs of audio monitors. Overkill*-ish*, but I like listening music in good conditions.

At work, I use a **MacBook Pro 13"** (*Core i7, 2.8GHz*, 16Go RAM), [covered with random stickers](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btdz-3jFqMb/).

I use the same keyboard/mouse combo for the two places : a [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse) and a custom Hi-Pro [OLKB Planck](https://olkb.com/planck), with *Cherry Red* keys and [*MiTo Legacy Keycaps*](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-x-mito-dsa-legacy-custom-keycap-set) - can be seen [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btdz-3jFqMb/).
