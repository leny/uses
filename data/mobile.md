My phone is an **iPhone X** (64Go), always in a neoprene sleeve [Crumpler](https://www.crumpler.eu).

I try a lot of apps, but I only regularly use theses ones:

- [CARROT Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/)
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) (a fantastic reddit client)
- [Twitterrific](https://twitterrific.com/mac)
- [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/)
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/)
- [Halide](https://halide.cam)
