After years on **Sublime Text** then **Atom**, I switched to [**(neo)vim**](https://neovim.io) two years ago.  
You can find my vim configuration [here](https://github.com/leny/pweneovim).

I use [**fish**](https://fishshell.com) as shell (in [**iTerm2**](https://www.iterm2.com)) with **tmux**.

My general dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/leny/pwendok).

I use [**tomorrow night eighties**](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) for theme, with [**Dank Mono**](https://dank.sh) font.

I use [docker](https://www.docker.com) and **docker-compose** for almost everything when it comes to dev environment setup.  
I even wrote a [dev-env *scaffolder*](https://github.com/becodeorg/cli) for my learners at BeCode, generating a docker-compose env from the command line.

Despite that I mainly use **git** in terminal (*like a boss*), I love using [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com) for some specific scenarios like *partial commits* or *cherry picking*.

I don't design as much as I was used too, but still a big fan of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) for webdesign stuffs.

And when I used to make psd-slicing for a living (in the dark times of, like, 2007), I absolutely loved [XScope](https://xscopeapp.com). Still use it sometimes.
