I love my Mac, but, damn, I never liked the Finder app. I used **PathFinder** for a long time, then fall in love with [Forklift](https://binarynights.com).

I'm a big fan of [Station](https://getstation.com), where I got access to *Slack*, *Ryver*, *WhatsApp*, *Google Drive* & *Agenda*, *Trello*, and many more.

I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) a lot. A lot. I have some personnal workflows, nothing really shareable (I type "*coding*" and it open my coding apps, or "*administrative*" for opening mail, billing stuffsâ€¦).

I use [Things](https://culturedcode.com) for handling tasks, [Airmail](https://airmailapp.com) for handling mails, and [Reeder](http://reederapp.com) for handling feeds.  
Oh, and [1Password](https://1password.com) for handling, huh, passwords and stuffs.

**Chrome**/[Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) for dev, [Brave](https://brave.com) for surfing.

Always behind a VPN. Currently using [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com).
