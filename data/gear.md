I do everything by foot.  
I've tried many backpacks over the years, loved Crumpler's ones for a long time, but stopped to use them for a [5.11 Rush Moab 10](https://www.511tactical.com/rush-moab-10.html).

It's packed with, like, *everything*, in a "EDC style": screwdrivers, first-aid kit, cables, [external battery](https://www.anker.com/fr/products/A1277011), a Leatherman, flashlight, working gloves, etc...

I'm not really a *prepper*, but I like to be *prepared*. Also, a lot of candy and an *emergency cuddle cloth*, as I have a little boy who like to run and climb *everywhere* and lost *everything*. ☺️

I have two pairs of bluetooth headphones: a pair of [Shure SE215](https://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones/se-earphones/se215-sound-isolating-earphones-hear-it-all), and a pair of [JBL T450BT](https://www.jbl.com/over-ear-headphones/JBL+T450BT.html) - the Shure are great for crowded places or when I don't want to be disturbed.
