After years on **Sublime Text** then **Atom**, I switched to [**(neo)vim**](https://neovim.io) two years ago.  
You can find my vim configuration [here](https://github.com/leny/pweneovim).

I use [**fish**](https://fishshell.com) as shell (in [**iTerm2**](https://www.iterm2.com)) with **tmux**.

My general dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/leny/pwendok).

I use [**tomorrow night eighties**](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) for theme, with [**Dank Mono**](https://dank.sh) font.
